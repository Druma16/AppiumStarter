Appium Starter
Sample Appium Automation in dotnet

Getting Started - November 2018 

Updated guide based on latest available version and proces, using Windows 10 64 bit, and Jetbrains Rider instead of Visual Studio

1. Install Java SDK
2. Install Android Studio (includes Android SDK, android SDK on it's own is not sufficient as Studio now required to run the Android emultator - AVD Manager)
3. Install node and npm from: https://nodejs.org/en/ (one install file for both, adds related system variables)
